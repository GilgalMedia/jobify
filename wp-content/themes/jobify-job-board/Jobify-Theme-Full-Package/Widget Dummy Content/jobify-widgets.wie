Archetypical examples of this are the woman who works as a waitress (her day job) while she tries to become an actress, and the professional athlete who works as a laborer in the off season because he is currently only able to make the roster of a semi-professional team.\r\n\r\nWhile many people do hold a full-time occupation, \"day job\" specifically refers to those who hold the position solely to pay living expenses so they can pursue, through low paying entry work, the job they really want (which may also be during the day).\r\n\r\n<a href=\"#\" class=\"button-secondary\">Learn More<\/a>","video":"http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=FG0fTKAqZ5g","animations":"1"},"jobify_widget_slider-1":{"slider":"","background":""},"jobify_widget_price_table_wc-1":{"title":"Plans and Pricing","description":""},"jobify_widget_callout-1":{"description":"We give you 30 days free post job access, so you can take some time to find the best plan for you.
